# PBP-TS-React

PBP-TS-React is a collection of small programs first written in Python several years ago. I decided to recreate the project using TypeScript and React to get more comfortable with TypeScript.

>Note: PBP stands for Project Based Python, a short YouTube playlist I created several years ago. It can be seen here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyHkjNMo67MWDY_fnHQ9Qu2CEXrx1TV_j&si=szmPGzZ6_HapdsA7
